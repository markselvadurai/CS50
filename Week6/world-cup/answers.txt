Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

with the highest ammount of simulations i did not expect the time to rise so drastically.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

the simulations seemed to have been at a good simulation:time ratio at around 10000 simulations.
