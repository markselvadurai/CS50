I would characterize the listeners audio aura as a moodier but danceable music most likely on the slow side due to the valence being so low and danceability being high while the energy is still decently high.
The listener might have been going through different phases which would make the assumptions about them from this list innaccurate. A better way to calculate it would be using dates to see their most recent or visited aura.
